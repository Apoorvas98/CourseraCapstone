# The Battle of Neighborhoods – Bangalore Edition
# Introduction:
Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru, is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more than 8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India. Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter. Indian technological organizations are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth or fifth-most productive metro area of India.
Owing to the population of Bangalore, transport and the time spent travelling every day is a huge issue today. On average, people spend about 2-2.5 hours in traffic every single day, and a major reason for this traffic is the number of cars on the road. We believe that if public transport were encouraged and the facilities were made more easily accessible, it could drastically cut down the number of personal cars on the road. So with this project, we’re going to analyze the areas that lack a good public transport system. To be precise, we will try to find the top 5 areas that need new bus stations based on the population.
